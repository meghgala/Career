All these puts together are the options available for students under the health science stream.  There is a lot of scope in paramedical courses also. The paramedical experts and doctors work hand in hand to treat the patients.  Paramedical courses can be little less stressful as there are no emergencies to attend like the doctors would need to. But both the medicine and paramedical professionals have a lot of challenges in the work life. There are few other options like research, insurance which also students can consider to choose as their career option to be in the health science field.
